<p>Ever worried about livestock and animals escaping your property? Ever wanted to keep those pesky animals from neighbours or the wild away? This Solar Electric Fence Energiser can accomplish it all. Whether it is used on the farm or just around your suburban home, the Solar Fence Energiser can be effective in either environment. Sporting a basic and simple to install design, you can have it up in a matter of minutes. Our range of Fence Energisers is compact, lightweight and versatile - making it an effective low maintenance item around the property. The units are designed solely to keep pets and livestock in or out of your property. Be it a few hundred metres or 5 km, our Fence Energiser can continuously keep your fence charged. If activated by an animal making contact with the fence, the unit will only generate a brief pulse to prevent harmful electric shocks as the voltage will drop from 8KV to 1.2KV (which is still enough to make the animals back off). We now offer our Electric Fence Energisers with bonus warning signs, polywire and insulators.</p>
